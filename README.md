## Introduction
The purpose of this project is study the relationship between Machine-Learning and Algebraic Geometry. By understanding this relationship, we obtain a better understanding of how machine-learning works and gain the ability to apply concepts from differential geometry while building models.

This github project holds all code used to generate the literature. You can find the latest version of the book [here](https://github.com/samuel-cavazos/Differential-Geometry-Machine-Learning/blob/main/book.pdf).
